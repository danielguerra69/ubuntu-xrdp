Subject: Fix permissions between xrdp and sesman.
 Attempt to fix connection problem between xrdp-sesman (running
 as root) and xrdp (running as xrdp) by creating the socket for
 the xorgxrdp server as 0660 in a sgid-xrdp directory, since we
 can’t easily chgrp here; also fix retval check for listen(2)
